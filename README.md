# Monte Carlo Discounted Cash Flow (MCDCF)

## Overview

The Monte Carlo Discounted Cash Flow tool is designed for property investors who want to forecast the potential financial performance of their investments. This application helps you evaluate how various economic and property-specific factors may influence your cash flow over time. By simulating multiple scenarios, it provides an informed projection of key metrics such as cash flows and internal rate of return (IRR), empowering you to make better investment decisions.

## The Problem It Solves

Making a real estate investment involves uncertainty. Market conditions, economic factors, and property-specific costs can change over time, and predicting these changes can be challenging. Many investors struggle to understand how variables like inflation, economic growth, and interest rates might affect the performance of their investments. This application solves the problem by using Monte Carlo simulations to model a wide range of possible future scenarios. It provides you with a probabilistic forecast of your investment's performance, showing potential outcomes rather than a single deterministic forecast. With this tool, you can better gauge the risks and rewards associated with a property, helping you to plan and strategize more effectively.
